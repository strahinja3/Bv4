                        <h3>Our Story</h3>

                        <p>
                            Our story began in 2007, when our company was established
                            under the name Web Solutions, offering ground-breaking web
                            solutions and online marketing services to big and 
                            mid-sized companies. Fast forward four years and Web Solutions
                            joins forces with a company called Media Services to form
                            a corporate company called Cubes. Today, Cubes is an
                            industry leader offering full IT support. From web to
                            mobile development to education and outsourcing, Cubes
                            is truly a one of a kind company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cubes started out with a goal of combining all IT services
                            in one place. We wanted to offer our clients quality
                            products at a reasonable price. To accomplish our goal,
                            we adapted the vertical integration strategy that allows
                            us to control each aspect of our business process. 
                            The big advantage we have over other IT companies
                            is that we educate our own employees. Cubes formed
                            a school that has, so far, successfully produced 5
                            generations of web and mobile developers. In fact, 
                            most of our employees today are Cubes School graduates.
                            “Cubes School” is a project we are very passionate about,
                            and extremely proud of. It allows us to not only contribute
                            to Serbia’s economy, but also have an endless supply of
                            extremely intelligent and hardworking developers, which
                            is what differentiates us from other companies.

                        <h3>Our Model</h3>
                        <p>
                            As mentioned before, Cubes School is what really gives
                            us an edge over our competitors and is also the core of
                            our business model. We educate over 200 new programmers
                            each year, and we keep the best 100 on retainer to work
                            on our projects. Some of them are outsourced to other companies,
                            while others work on in-house projects. While many IT companies
                            deal with a shortage of quality programmers, we always have
                            more than enough available talent to work on our projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
